            <p> Hi! I'm Chachi. Iâ€™m a highly motivated and resourceful interpreneur, 
                and i've been at it for the past 15+ years. 
                During my years of experience, I've been able to focus in the fields 
                I love most: Event production, Marketing, Web Design & Development and my biggest 
                passion, DJing. When I'm not making dreams come to life, I'm mostly spending time 
                with my beautiful kitty Purrl, or searching for the next big adventure with my partner 
                in crime.</p>
            
            <p> I hope I'm able to help you find what you're looking for!</p>
